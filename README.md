Overview
This project provides a pipeline for emotion classification using a fine-tuned BERT model. The model can classify text data into specific emotional categories (e.g., Anger, Joy, Sadness, etc.) by leveraging pre-trained language representations from BERT and fine-tuning them on a labeled dataset.

Requirements
Before running the code, ensure that you have the following packages installed in your Python environment:

PyTorch
Transformers
Pandas
Scikit-learn
You can install these using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install torch transformers pandas scikit-learn
Note: If you have a GPU, make sure to install the GPU-optimized version of PyTorch to speed up training and inference.

Data Preparation
You will need a training and a test dataset in CSV format. The CSV files should contain at least the following:

A column with the text data to classify.
A corresponding label column indicating the emotion.
For example, github-train.csv and github-test.csv might look like this:

arduino
Copy code
text,Anger
"This is terrible.",1
"I love this!",0
...
Note: The --col argument in the script corresponds to the label column that will be used for classification. In the above example, --col=Anger means the script will use the "Anger" column as the target for classification. Make sure your CSV's label column name matches the value you pass to --col.

Fine-Tuned BERT Model
You need a fine-tuned BERT model available locally. The --model argument should point to a directory or a file path containing the fine-tuned model weights and configuration. For example, if your model directory is named fine_tuned_bert/, it might contain:

config.json
pytorch_model.bin
vocab.txt (if not using a pre-existing vocabulary)
Refer to the Transformers documentation for details on saving and loading fine-tuned models.

Running the Classification Script
The main entry point for running the classification is 1_bert-classification.py. This script handles:

Loading the fine-tuned BERT model.
Reading the training and test datasets.
Training the classifier (if training is required).
Evaluating the model on the test dataset.
Arguments
--epoch: Number of training epochs.
--model: Path to the fine-tuned BERT model (directory or file).
--traindata: Path to the training data CSV.
--testdata: Path to the test data CSV.
--col: Name of the column representing the emotion in the dataset.
Example
bash
Copy code
python 1_bert-classification.py \
    --epoch 1 \
    --model fine_tuned_bert \
    --traindata=github-train.csv \
    --testdata=github-test.csv \
    --col=Anger
This command will run the script for 1 epoch using the model located in fine_tuned_bert/, training on github-train.csv, testing on github-test.csv, and using the "Anger" column as the emotion label.

Results
After running the script, it will print out evaluation metrics (e.g., accuracy, F1 score) for the test set. You can also inspect predictions and model outputs for further analysis.

Troubleshooting
Model not found error: Ensure the --model path is correct and contains the model files.
Data file not found: Check that the --traindata and --testdata paths point to existing CSV files.
CUDA errors: If using a GPU, ensure CUDA is properly installed. If you encounter GPU-related issues, try running on CPU by removing CUDA references or installing a CPU-only PyTorch version.
